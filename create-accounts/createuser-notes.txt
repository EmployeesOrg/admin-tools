  X In account/lib/NewAccount/ - CreateAccount.pm is not used, correct?
    [ Correct.  It is not use.  The makeuser script does all the work]

  - Installed /usr/ports/lang/p5-Error

  - Installed /usr/ports/mail/p5-Mail-Sendmail

  - Need to eliminate the possiblly confused characters from the Key 
    string - 'O' vs '0', 'l' vs '1', etc.

  X Need to think through ownerships of directories and who the server run 
    as.  Did is suEXEC as user "admin"?  It looks like it did, but I need 
    to figure out how to turn that on at home.
    [ we run as admin, being run via https://www.employees.org/~admin/ ]

  X We no longer need the popme stuff.  Are there things we'd like to add 
    at this point?

  X WIERD!  PageCreateAccount.pm emits it's page but fails to execute 
    anything after the call to send_bottom(); when send_bottom() does a 
    close STDOUT.  If I comment out the close, the module executes 
    successfully.  If I move send_bottom() to the end of run() (so the
    close STDOUT is the last thing done), it runs OK.  But if I leave 
    things as it is it silently fails.  No mail to sponsor ("otherwise" 
    clause), no unlink of the token file.  Nothing in any of the log 
    files.  Nothing.  It seems like the CGI process is killed when it
    the running program closes stdout.

    For now, I've moved the send_bottom() to the end of run().
    [Apache v1.3.x vs v2.x - works fine in Apache v2.x - K^2]
  

  - installed /usr/ports/lang/p5-Expect, which dragged a lot of 
    p5-Tty/Stty stuff with it.

  - We need to port webit to fix directory group ownership and permissions.
    x Where are the sources?  
      [On TOS in /usr/local/src/webit/]
    x do port
      [Port requires /usr/lib/perl5.005 to work - 5.8.4 works, but pod2usage() 
       fails on writing man pages]

  - Installed Term::ReadKey  for makeuser script.

  - Adding a new Column to accounts database (for Last Accessed)
    We want to change the "created" from a TIMESTAMP to a DATETIME field,  
    add a "record_updated" timestamp in front of created, and add a 
    "last_accessed" to keep track of when the account was last accessed 
    (NOT THE RECORD!).  This will take a few steps.

    Make a backup dump with:

    mysqldump admin -u admin -p > admin.dump

    After backup.

    mysql
    use admin;    # admin is the database
    # Create our new columns
    alter table accounts add column last_accessed datetime;
    alter table accounts add column created_safety datetime;
    alter table accounts add column alternate_contact varchar(50) default NULL after pgp;
    alter table accounts add column record_updated timestamp after alternate_contact;
    
    # Now we do the update.  note well the "created = created".  That keeps it
    # from changing during this update!

    update accounts set created_safety = created, created = created, record_updated = NOW(), last_accessed = NOW();

    # Now change the created column from a timestamp to a datetime
    alter table accounts drop column created;
    alter table accounts add column created datetime;
    update accounts set created = created_safety;

    # Now clean up our temp column
    alter table accounts drop column created_safety;


    # Now add a last_accessed to accounts_deleted table
    alter table accounts_deleted add column last_accessed datetime;
    alter table accounts_deleted add column alternate_contact varchar(50) default NULL after pgp;


  - Stuff is spread out all over the place.
    /users/admin/SWWW/newacct.cgi 
    /users/admin/newacct/lib/NewAcct/ - for the .pm used by newacct.cgi
    /var/newacct/error_log      - Log of newacct.cgi
    /var/newacct/tokens         - token holding for account creation.

    /var/newacct/config         - used by AccountDB.pm, which is used by 
    /usr/local/admin/makeuser   - suid perl script to make users.
    /usr/local/admin/EmlpOrg/   - .pm used by makeuser to access the MySQL database.

    /usr/local/bin/webit        - SUID wrapper around perl script to set group
                                  and permissions for web access.
    /usr/local/libexec/webit.pl - The script itself.


    All perl modules go under /usr/local/admin/lib/, EmplOrg and NewAcct

    /var/newacct need to be chown admin:staff

    The makeuser needs a C suid wrapper to get the effective UID of root.
    Install that bin in /usr/local/admin/bin/, put the makeuser.pl in
    /usr/local/admin/libexec/.  Crank the permissions down hard!

    The newacct.cgi has to go into /users/admin so it will suexec as "admin"
    and then be able to run the /usr/local/admin/bin/makeuser script to actually
    create the account.

    - Need to update text referring to the FAQ.  Currently says ~admin/
      Find out new location and update.
